      <p>I&rsquo;m a fan of ZeroMQ and recently got notice of a new (to me) project
in the ZeroMQ organization called <strong>ingescape</strong>.  Here I give a somewhat
superficial &ldquo;review&rdquo; of this package as I simultaneously dig in and
learn about it.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#summary">#</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zeromq/ingescape">ingescape</a> is a layer on top of Zyre to provide a simplified basis for
developing distributed applications by abstracting away much of the
details related to managing sockets.</p>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> supports two high level distributed processing patterns:</p>
<dl>
<dt>data flow</dt>
<dd>flow graph model with nodes having named and typed
input or output ports and with edges implemented via PUB/SUB links</dd>
<dt>services</dt>
<dd>reliable, addressed one-way notifications over Zyre chat
(not just request/reply as it is billed, see below)</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> is implemented in C on CZMQ, Zyre and libsodium with no
other dependencies.  It provides a <code>zproject</code> API (but not following
CLASS) so in principle the package can automatically generate
low-level bindings to other languages.</p>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> lets us develop &ldquo;agents&rdquo; with only a modest amount of code
devoted to socket wrangling allowing us to focus on functionality.  A
given agent may be developed with minimal (but not zero, see
discussion below) knowledge about the agent&rsquo;s peers.</p>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#impressions">#</a> </h2>
<p>I see in <strong>ingescape</strong> many of the themes I have explored in the <a href="https://wirecell.github.io/">Wire-Cell
Toolkit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brettviren/ptmp/">PTMP</a>, <a href="https://brettviren.github.io/zio/">ZIO</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brettviren/yamz">YAMZ</a>.  In particular the idea of a &ldquo;ported flow
graph&rdquo; providing the context for distributed execution can be seen in
<strong>ingescape</strong>&rsquo;s <em>data flow</em> (and in its <em>services</em> for that matter) as well as
exploiting discovery and distributed configuration, specifically with Zyre.</p>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> looks like a very good basis for many classes of distributed
processes relevant to my area including DAQ, distributed parallel data
processing, GPU-as-a-service, etc.  From a point of view of
contemplating what it would be like to adopt <strong>ingescape</strong> in the projects
like those I name above, I give some initial impressions and
unsolicited suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="nic-device">NIC device&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#nic-device">#</a> </h3>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> examples use the NIC device name (and a TCP/IP port) as an
agent endpoint identifier.  This is somewhat unusual (at least in my
experience) but it makes some sense when you think that <strong>ingescape</strong>
tries to abstract away network.</p>
<p>Trying the <strong>ingescape</strong> tests on the <code>lo</code> device was not successful:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">igsTester --device &#34;lo&#34; --port 5670 --verbose --auto
tester;ERROR;igs_start_with_device;IP address could not be determined on device lo : our agent will NOT start
</code></pre></div><p>Perhaps something is wrongly configured here though I believe my <code>lo</code> is default from the Debian factory.  It looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ip a
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
</code></pre></div><p>Beside whatever is going on there, using a NIC device name as an
endpoint identifier has at least two problems.  First, for a human,
their names are hard to predict and remember.  Once I use the
obviously <code>/s</code> named <code>wlp82s0</code> device the <strong>ingescape</strong> tests run fine.</p>
<p>Second would be the (admittedly rare) situation of having one NIC
serve multiple IP addresses.  I don&rsquo;t know how ZeroMQ handles this but
I guess it must either listen either on all or onnly on the &ldquo;first&rdquo; in
some order.  Neither policy would fit all uses of multi-IP NICs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, digging into the code I find two functions that instead
take ZeroMQ <code>tcp://</code> endpoint addresses:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">igs_start_with_ip()
igs_start_with_brokers()
</code></pre></div><p>The latter allows for TCP-based gossip discovery (instead of Zyre&rsquo;s default UDP).  That&rsquo;s nice!</p>
<h3 id="services">Services&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#services">#</a> </h3>
<p>The &ldquo;services&rdquo; feature is described as &ldquo;request/reply&rdquo; and &ldquo;RPC/RMI&rdquo;.
However, it appears rather more general than that.  At its essential,
I would describe the &ldquo;services&rdquo; feature as a one-way, one-shot,
peer-addressed notification mechanism.  The example applications
&ldquo;merely&rdquo; approximates the usual RPC pattern by having the request
method of the &ldquo;server&rdquo; call a (statically named) method back on the
&ldquo;sender&rdquo; in order to deliver a reply.  Thus the example applications
enact an asynchronous RPC with a hard-wired reply method name which is
in fact also an RPC call made in a symmetric manner as the original
&ldquo;request&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But, the essential nature of <strong>ingescape</strong> &ldquo;services&rdquo; also allow other
behavior patterns.  The possibilities can perhaps be well described in
email terms if we think of <code>user@host</code> email address strings to map to
be interpreted as <code>method@peer</code> and method arguments to play a role
similar to email headers.  We might then imagine these patterns of
behavior:</p>
<dl>
<dt>static-reply</dt>
<dd>as in the example, the &ldquo;service&rdquo; replies via the
sender ID and a static, hard-wired method name.  Analogous to a
<code>Reply-To: static@sender</code> requiring sender to have method (user) name
called <code>static</code>.</dd>
<dt>dynamic-reply</dt>
<dd>a service method call arguments may include a
method name that the service is expected to use for a reply.  Eg,
<code>call(reply=&quot;dynamic&quot;)</code> causes a reply to <code>dynamic@sender</code>.  This
decouples the caller/callee development a little.</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>Like <strong>dynamic-reply</strong> but with a list of <code>method@peer</code> pairs.
The service would be programmed to iterate on this list and send the
reply to each entry.</dd>
<dt>forward</dt>
<dd>a service may call to another peer which is hard-wired in
the service.  Analogous to the use of a <code>~/.forward</code> file for email
delivery.</dd>
<dt>ignore</dt>
<dd>the service may simply not reply to the original sender.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And, of course, a &ldquo;service&rdquo; method may implement a mix of these
patterns either statically or dynamically depending on method
arguments or external factors.</p>
<h3 id="mapping">Mapping&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#mapping">#</a> </h3>
<p>For <strong>ingescape</strong> <strong>data flow</strong> this function is provided:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C">igs_mapping_add(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;input&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;peer&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;output&#34;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>When called in the context of defining an agent, this function call
declares the agent&rsquo;s <code>input</code> port shall receive messages that the <code>peer</code>
may send out its own <code>output</code> port.  Presumably, <code>peer:ouput</code> maps to a
PUB and <code>agent:input</code> to a SUB and then Zyre is used to discover the addresses for their <code>bind()/connect()</code> calls.</p>
<p>The abstraction this function provides is very good.  However, the
examples show the function being called in the context of the agent&rsquo;s
<code>main()</code>.  This conflates implementation of agent functionality with
peer linkage.</p>
<p>This conflation is somewhat softened when instead of the mapping being
hard-wired it is built from a user-provided JSON text with a call to
the function <code>igs_mapping_load_file()</code>.  This leaves it to the user to
determine graph linkage.</p>
<p>A side comment on that mapping JSON: the <code>toOutput</code> and <code>fromInput</code> key
names are rather confusing (to me) as to which side of what boundary
<code>to</code> and <code>from</code> refers.  My understanding is <code>to</code> refers to the sender while
<code>from</code> refers to the receiver which is rather backwards unless one reads
each to be from the point of view of their respective agent implementation.  Ie, a sender sends &ldquo;to output&rdquo; and a receiver receives &ldquo;from input&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In any case, forming a graph edge, either in the hard-coded way or
with the JSON object, is apparently done only from the implementation
of the &ldquo;target&rdquo; side of the edge.  This probably hints to a choice to
hard-wire PUB to <code>bind()</code>, SUB to <code>connect()</code>.  It is a reasonable,
simplifying choice.  A more general, complex one can be envisioned
where PUB and SUB may <code>bind()</code> and/or <code>connect()</code> as needed and linkage is
performed by a non-agent role through Zyre communication.  One benefit
from such a variant design would be to allow a SUB to live on an
accessible network while a PUB may be behind NAT.</p>
<h3 id="services-data-flow-dichotomy">Services/data-flow dichotomy&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#services-data-flow-dichotomy">#</a> </h3>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> provides this dichotomy between services and data flow which
is implemented in a somewhat uneven way.  On the one hand, the JSON
mapping gives the end user say in how the data flow graph is wired.
On the other hand, service calls use hard-wired identifiers or the
application developer may invent their own way to let users configure
the &ldquo;service graph&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I feel there is benefit to have <strong>ingescape</strong> provide first class support
in the JSON handling to configure services.  This can then allow
caller code development independent from details of callee.  The two
may use different identifiers for the service and the JSON may provide
a second kind of &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; between them.  It would also allow swapping
out different implementations of some &ldquo;service&rdquo; w/out concerns of
service or method name conflicts.</p>
<p>Second, with the data flow mapping context, it is also possible to
distribute service information in Zyre which can minimize user
configuration effort.  For example, a service may advertise in Zyre
its methods with each associated with a descriptive attribute set.  A
client may then match its needs, also expressed as an attribute set,
against attributes of the known services in order to locate a matching
callee.  This is the approach tried in YAMZ and is flexible but of
course more complex.</p>
<p>The other part of this dichotomy I find interesting is how it couples
input, operation and output.  This is not strictly required and one
can at least contemplate using an &ldquo;operation&rdquo; function in either a
data flow or service context.  The proper context to apply could
depend on how the user configures the &ldquo;flow graph&rdquo; and &ldquo;service
graph&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This factoring could be provide at application level or better made
first class in <strong>ingescape</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#configuration">#</a> </h3>
<p>The JSON &ldquo;definition&rdquo; and &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; file types are good.  However,
they still rely on application code to register an association between
an input observer (<code>igs_observe_input()</code>) and the data flow node input
port name.  Likewise, a service method function must be registered to
its externally known name via <code>igs_service_init()</code>.  This is very
reasonable and simple.  But it requires custom <code>main()</code> programs for
each agent holding largely boilerplate code.</p>
<p>Two patterns used in Wire-Cell Toolkit and PTMP are &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; and
&ldquo;named factory&rdquo;.  These patterns allow shared libraries to provide
compiled functions which can be mapped via configuration strings.
Adding them to the mix would allow a single, generic <code>main()</code> agent
program and would allow configuration to fully drive the make up of
the application.  <code>dlopen()</code> is needed for C/C++ which may entail some
portability issues.  The same pattern can also be enacted in Python
(if/when <strong>ingescape</strong> apps are developed in that language).</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing">Load balancing&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#load-balancing">#</a> </h3>
<p>In the README overview on data flow is this tantalizing comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>optional capability to dispatch data between workers for workload distribution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not determine what this implies though certainly any &ldquo;service&rdquo;
or &ldquo;data flow&rdquo; node would be free to operate as a Majordomo client.</p>
<h3 id="lossy-data-flow">Lossy data flow&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#lossy-data-flow">#</a> </h3>
<p>Use of PUB/SUB for data flow has one very substantial issue: there is
no back pressure.  Data <strong>will</strong> be lost when an upstream node outpaces a
downstream node long enough for the PUB/SUB buffers to reach HWM.
This may actually be a desirable feature for some systems while
utterly disastrous for others.  Adopters should consider if this lossy
reality is acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> can be used also to form lossless, back-pressured graphs
using purely the service pattern.  This rides on Zyre chat and thus
can rely on ROUTER/DEALER mute policy of block when HWM is hit.
Bouncing against a socket&rsquo;s high-water marks degrades throughput
compared to other flow-control mechanisms.  If both lossless and very
high rates are needed then a better type of flow control is needed.
The credit-based flow control described in the zguide, and implemented
in ZIO, is one good approach.  Adding this as a first-class transport
in <strong>ingescape</strong> might be worth considering if one needs such performance.</p>
<h3 id="splitting"><span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Splitting&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#splitting">#</a> </h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s something hinted about &ldquo;splits&rdquo; which I didn&rsquo;t look into yet.</p>
<h2 id="end-note">End note&nbsp;<a class="headline-hash" href="#end-note">#</a> </h2>
<p><strong>ingescape</strong> looks very exciting and codifies many ideas I have wanted to
see or have realized.  I suggest some things which may potentially
bring improvement but come with a cost of increasing complexity.</p>
<p>Finally, like all good software, <strong>ingescape</strong> has an ambiguous
pronunciation.  Is it ing-escape?  inge-scape?  I don&rsquo;t know, but I
like it.</p>
