** Packages

I currently use [[https://github.com/brettviren/][GitHub/brettviren]] for all my publicly available software, documentation and configuration.  

- [[https://brettviren.github.io/moo/][moo]] is a tool for schema driven code generation used in DUNE-DAQ and others.
- [[https://brettviren.github.io/zio/][zio]] provides a high-level interface to ZeroMQ, Zyre and implements some patterns described in the zguide.  Provides the ~domo~ and ~flow~ protocols.
- [[https://github.com/brettviren/yamz][yamz]] is you and me, Zyre.
- [[https://github.com/brettviren/gegede][gegede]] is for general geometry description (for describing detector geometry).
- [[https://brettviren.github.io/herbie][herbie]] is a herbstluftwm interactive environment thingy.
- [[https://github.com/brettviren/rephile][rephile]] photo manager
- [[https://brettviren.github.io/cppzmq-tour][cppzmq tour]] gives a walk through of one of the C++ bindings to ZeroMQ (and a wip companion giving a cppzmq version of ZeroMQ security [[https://github.com/brettviren/cppzmq-houses]["houses"]]).
  - related [[https://github.com/brettviren/generaldomo][generaldomo]] generalizes ZeroMQ majordomo to CLIENT/SERVER sockets (see also ~domo~ in ZIO)
- [[https://github.com/brettviren/zperfmq][zperfmq]] tests ZeroMQ performance, applied to a 100 Gbps test network.
- [[https://github.com/brettviren/gravio][gravio]] plays with graph visualization.
- Two implementations of [[https://github.com/barabo/advanced-shell-history][advanced-shell-history]]: [[https://github.com/brettviren/fishql][fishql]] for Fish shell and [[https://github.com/brettviren/shist][shist]] for Bash shell.
- [[https://github.com/brettviren/nuosc][nuosc++]] package for calculating neutrino oscillation probabilities in vacuum, constant and arbitrary matter.
- [[https://github.com/brettviren?tab=repositories][all my repos]] including many experimental dead ends and a few forked from others.
